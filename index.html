				</div>

				<p>As a part of my studies, I wrote a thesis on the practical application on the theory of game feel. 
				You can read it <a class="plain" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href="http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:amk-2020120325927">here</a> if you happen to be able to read Finnish. 
				Otherwise, click the "read more" -button for a translated version.</p>
				
				<p>I developed both OCDA and Chucksaw as a part of this thesis in order to put the theory into practice.</p>

				Quick and snappy visuals combined with crunchy 8-bit sound effects make every input feel instantly gratifying.</p> 
				
				<p>Chucksaw was developed in just two weeks in an experiment to develop a very simple gameplay idea 
				that was then polished to the extreme. You can totally wreck friendships in this game.</p>

				This includes various aspects such as considerate level design, input buffering, edge shaving and much more! 
				You'll never miss a jump due to jank in this game.</p> 
				
				<p>I spent a few months working on it during my own time in the evenings after work. The end result is a precision platformer filled to the brim

				Chase out targets, then dive into the melee with your hand-picked team of gangsters or detectives.</p> 
				
				<p>I worked as the level designer, joining the production in the alpha stages. 
				It's the biggest production I've been a part of so far and I'm really proud of the work I did there. 
				It was overall just a very positive experience to work there.</p>

				<p>I joined in as the producer in alpha, later also working in the design field, level design in particular. A vicious content cut made in early alpha ended up making Korpus a viable commercial release instead of a demo.</p>

				<p>This project was a bit different as we only had 3 people in the team in total. Due to the conditions, 
				I mainly worked as an artist, creating the character art and animations, level tilesets, UI and FX. 
				I also made some SFX and music in this one!</p>
				
				<p>It was a great opportunity to see things from a different perspective 
				in a more commercial project instead of a jam game.</p>

				<p>This was my first project as a designer for a commercial release.
				I was the only designer in the team, so I got to learn a bunch about all sorts of design. 
				After systems design, most of the work done was centered around level design.</p>

				<p>I was the Speaker Manager for the event in 2018, 
				being in charge of recruiting speakers for the event as well as organizing travels and accommodation. During the event my task 
				was to make sure we were running in schedule.</p>
				
				<p>Being a major part in organizing this event was probably the most difficult thing I've done to date, 
				but it was also incredibly satisfying to see all my hard work and sleepless nights pay off and culminating 
				in the best games conference in Finland. *cough cough*</p>
