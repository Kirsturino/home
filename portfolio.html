Will you build an influential criminal empire, or head up an elite Scotland Yard task force and crack down on the rising tide of corruption? Chase out targets, then dive into the melee with your hand-picked team of gangsters or detectives. </p> 
				
				<p>I worked as the level designer, joining the production in the alpha stages. It's the biggest production I've been a part of so far and I'm really proud of the work I did there. It was overall just a very positive experience, working there.<p>

			<p>I joined in as the producer in Alpha, later also working in the design field, level design in particular. A vicious content cut made in early Alpha ended up making Korpus a viable commercial release instead of a demo.</p>

			<p>This project was a bit different as we only had 3 people in the team in total. Due to the conditions, 
			I mainly worked as an artist, creating the character art and animations, level tilesets, UI and FX. 
			I also made some SFX and music in this one!</p>
			
			<p>It was a great opportunity to see things from a different perspective 
			in a more commercial project instead of a jam game.</p>

				<p>This was my first project as a designer for a commercial release.
				I was the only designer in the team, so I got to learn a bunch about all sorts of design. 
				After systems design, most of the work done was centered around level design. </p>

				<h2>Gaming Conference</h2>
				<p><a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href = "https://www.northerngamesummit.org">Northern Game Summit (2018)</a> is one of the biggest game conferences in Finland held yearly in Kajaani. In 2018 we had speakers from 
				Blizzard, Santa Monica, Remedy, Guerrilla, CD Projekt Red and more!</p>
				
				<p>I was the Speaker Manager for the event in 2018, 
				being in charge of recruiting speakers for the event as well as organizing travels and accommodation. During the event my task 
				was to make sure we were running in schedule.</p>
				
				<p>Being a major part in organizing this event was probably the most difficult thing I've done to date, 
				but it was also incredibly satisfying to see all my hard work and sleepless nights pay off and culminating 
				in the best games conference in Finland. *cough cough*</p>

				<p><a class = "normal" target="_blank" rel= "noopener" href = "https://kirstu.itch.io/sub-sonar">Sub Sonar (2018)</a> is a global game jam game turned into a personal project. It's a randomly generated, slow paced, audio driven exploration game where you scan the deep sea looking for treasure.</p> 
					
				<p>The theme for the jam was transmission and quickly we decided to make a radar mechanic where you could only see things as visual representations in your radar. I was just learning programming at the time, but I'm very happy with the results. The jam game was nice, but the real gratification came from taking it, polishing it every now and then for a couple months and finally releasing it. There were still a lot of features I wanted to add, but decided against it. I'm glad I did!</p>
