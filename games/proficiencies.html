				</div>
				<p>My formal education in Kajaani University of Applied Sciences is that of a producer, but I am mainly interested in game design and have taken every opportunity to learn it.</p>
	
				<p>As a designer, I am most interested in action gameplay systems. I like to establish clear and solid second-to-second gameplay loops first and foremost. My other passion lies in digging deep into mechanical systems and finding out what makes them tick. Things like delving deep into the stats and rules of Dark Souls or Destiny are where I sink most of my time when playing games. It's not unusual to find myself minmaxing most things in games.</p>
			
				<p>The thing I'm currently trying to master is  the ever elusive term game feel and juice in action games. Things like finding all the seemingly invisible factors that go into creating a system where every input feels satisfying to the player. In addition to that I've also been demystifying the term oil regarding game development and its utilities.</p>
			
				<p>My superpower as a developer is definitely scoping. Whether it be the entire project, a system or a subsystem. I have the ability to decide which aspect of a given thing is integral and which can be left in the wish list. As a direct result, I find the MVP document the most important when starting pre-production in a project.</p>

We held weekly lectures about various subjects, mostly practical things that they wouldn't otherwise have no way of knowing when starting production. This includes stuff like pitching, the different roles in game production, documentation and agile. Some design lectures I held include explaining the Theory of Fun and User Experience Design.</li>
